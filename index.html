      <h4 id="day1"> Day 1</h4>
      <p> On our first day, we started
        by visiting <strong> Montmartre </strong> right away.
        Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower
        (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate
        dinner at a cute little bistro
        overlooking <strong> la Seine. </strong>

      <h4 id="day2"> Day 2</h4>
      <p> On our second day, we went shopping on <strong> Avenue des Champs Elysees. </strong>
        Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br />
After we finished shopping, we visited some really
beautiful places! We went to <strong> Notre Dame.</strong> <br />We went on a
macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best
macarons the city had
to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <strong> le Louvre.</strong></p>

      <h4 id="day3"> Day 3</h4>
      The picture below is of me visiting the <em> Arc de Triomphe. </em>
      It's huge! We also went to <em> le Musee D'Orsay.</em> Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet,
      and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking.
      I was surprised to see that the museum also had
      many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.
